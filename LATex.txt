\section*{Summary}
Results-oriented and adaptable software developer with a proven track record in tackling challenges of various scales and technologies. Passionate about problem-solving, I thrive in roles where I'm handed a problem, regardless of scale or technology, and figure out the best solutions. Currently leading the software team at Waltr. With a curiosity that extends to almost everything, I'm an avid reader, and in my spare time, a wannabe writer.
